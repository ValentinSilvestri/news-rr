## CSS Assignment: RR news

The assignment consisted of formatting an article using HTML and CSS:
I kept working on the news I've chosen before: **[Why (and How) I Plan to Die With an Empty Bank Account](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-03/why-and-how-i-plan-to-die-with-an-empty-bank-account)**. File name: index_2.html.

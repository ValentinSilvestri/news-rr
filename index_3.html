                        At Argentine brokerages and banks, the calls come in every day with the same question: How many 
                        dollars does the central bank actually have?

                        Keeping a close eye on international reserves has become a ritual for Argentine investors as they 
                        try to figure out what comes next for the peso and

                        Calculations for the exact amount of net liquid reserves vary from negative $2 billion to as high 
                        as $1.3 billion depending on how various piles of money are counted, but almost everyone agrees 
                        that it’s ominously low. As the balance heads ever lower, the government is piling on measures to 
                        stop the bleeding. The

                         came last week as officials cut taxes on some exports, said they would allow a faster devaluation 
                         of the peso and raised a local interest rate in their desperate effort to hold onto dollars.

                        <q>I’m getting hammered with questions and calls</q>, said Juan Manuel Pazos, chief economist at 
                        TPCG Valores in Buenos Aires. <q>What they want to know is our view and how we expect policy makers

                        While Argentina’s central bank publishes its total dollar reserves five times a week, investors 
                        are most interested in the country’s net liquid reserves, basically what’s available in cash. 
                        That figure is just a fraction of the $41.3 billion gross amount, but arriving at an exact number 
                        is tricky. The central bank doesn’t tally it on its own and a press official declined to comment on 
                        analysts’ estimates.

                        In mid-September, Argentina had tried to limit the drawdown by putting severe

                        on dollar purchases, both for individuals and companies, but demand for greenbacks showed no signs 
                        of slowing. A parallel exchange rate used to skirt controls has fallen to a record, with the peso 
                        worth almost half of what it fetches in the official market.

                        Meanwhile, prices for Argentine bonds issued just a month ago have fallen ever deeper into

                        , with most new dollar notes trading at around 40 cents on the dollar.

                        It’s all a giant vote of no confidence in President Alberto Fernandez’s administration just weeks 
                        after the country won some

                         of savings in its restructuring with promises of stability to come. Inflation has remained stubbornly 
                         above 40%, unemployment is at a 16-year high and Argentina’s economy is forecast to shrink 12% this 
                         year, its worst one-year contraction on record.

                    <p>
                        Amid the gloom, investors are focused on international reserves as a key indicator. To calculate 
                        how much of its own money the central bank has on hand, analysts first subtract $12 billion of 
                        commercial bank deposits from the 
                        <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QHLG9TT0AFBJ" target="_blank">$41.2 billion</a>
                         figure for gross international reserves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then there are approximately $25 billion of currency swaps, drawing rights and other lines that 
                        aren’t liquid. Some shops also exclude $2.4 billion from repo operations and U.S. bills. And 
                        without the $3.7 billion of gold bars, net liquid reserves are negative $2 billion, according 
                        to Portfolio Personal Inversiones estimates. That’s a similar number to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s 
                        latest calculations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But other shops are more generous in calculating reserves. TPCG Valores counts $200 million of 
                        liquid reserves and Eco Go says the total may have been as high as $1.3 billion as of the end 
                        of September.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea of leaving nonprofits money in our will also feels a bit detrimental to the causes we want 
                        to support. Why not give sooner if we can? To that end, I’ve automated some of my giving plans 
                        similar to how we contribute for retirement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Almost half the gross reserves amount comes from a 130 billion yuan ($19.1 billion) currency swap 
                        with the People’s Bank of China. It’s been around for more than a decade and was 
                        <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QENZA4DWRGG0" target="_blank">renewed</a>
                         in early August.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The swap line allows Argentina to ask for the money if it needs it, though the PBOC is under no 
                        obligation to disburse it, according to Fausto Spotorno, economist and director of the Orlando 
                        Ferreres & Asociados consultancy in Buenos Aires.

                        If the country asks for the money, it will need to start paying interest on the credit line. The 
                        same happens if Argentina taps the $3.2 billion that comes from a line with the Bank for 
                        International Settlements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Argentina also has $2.8 billion of Special Drawing Rights with the International Monetary Fund, 
                        which could probably be converted to cash fairly easily, though the fund’s board would have to 
                        approve. Then there’s the gold bars, which would have to be sold or offered as collateral on a 
                        loan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>It would be a really bad sign if the central bank sells the gold</q> because it’s a source of 
                        stability, Anselmi said. <q>It’s like you have nothing left.</q>
